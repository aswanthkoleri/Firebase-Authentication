# Firebase-Authenthication
A simple implementation of Firebase Authentication

# How to run

- First we have to install Firebase cli.Run the command:

     `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- To connect your local machine to your Firebase account and obtain access to your Firebase projects, run the following command:

    `firbase login`

- From the root of your project directory, run the following command:

    `firebase init`

- Firebase and FirebaseUI do not work when executed directly from a file (i.e. opening the file in your browser, not through a web server). So run 

    `firebase serve`.

- The website is running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)
